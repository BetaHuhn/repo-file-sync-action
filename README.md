[![Build CI](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/workflows/Test%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Test+CI%22) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/blob/master/LICENSE) ![David](https://img.shields.io/david/betahuhn/repo-file-sync-action)

Keep files like Action workflows or entire directories in sync between multiple repositories.

</div>

## 👋 Introduction

With [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) you can sync files, like workflow `.yml` files, configuration files or whole directories between repositories or branches. It works by running a GitHub Action in your main repository everytime you push something to that repo. The action will use a `sync.yml` config file to figure out which files it should sync where. If it finds a file which is out of sync it will open a pull request in the target repository with the changes.

## 🚀 Features

- Keep GitHub Actions workflow files in sync across all your repositories
- Sync any file or a whole directory to as many repositories as you want
- Easy configuration for any use case
- Create a pull request in the target repo so you have the last say on what gets merged
- Automatically label pull requests to integrate with other actions like [automerge-action](https://github.com/pascalgn/automerge-action)
- Assign users to the pull request

## 📚 Usage


### Workflow

Create a `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` folder (you can find more info about the structure in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)):

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
name: Sync Files
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run GitHub File Sync
        uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@v1
        with:
          GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
```

#### Token

In order for the Action to access your repositories you have to specify a [Personal Access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) as the value for `GH_PAT` (`GITHUB_TOKEN` will **not** work). The PAT needs the full repo scope ([#31](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/discussions/31#discussioncomment-674804)).

It is recommended to set the token as a
[Repository Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

Alternatively, you can provide the token of a GitHub App Installation via the `GH_INSTALLATION_TOKEN` input. You can obtain such token for example via [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-app-token) action. Tokens from apps have the advantage that they provide more granular access control.

The app needs to be configured for each repo you want to sync to, and have the `Contents` read & write and `Metadata` read-only permission. If you want to use PRs (default setting) you additionally need `Pull requests` read & write access, and to sync workflow files you need `Workflows` read & write access.

If using an installation token you are required to provide the `GIT_EMAIL` and `GIT_USERNAME` input.

### Sync configuration

The last step is to create a `.yml` file in the `.github` folder of your repository and specify what file(s) to sync to which repositories:

**.github/sync.yml**

```yml
user/repository:
  - .github/workflows/test.yml
  - .github/workflows/lint.yml

user/repository2:
  - source: workflows/stale.yml
    dest: .github/workflows/stale.yml
```

More info on how to specify what files to sync where [below](#%EF%B8%8F-sync-configuration).

### Versioning

To always use the latest version of the action add the `latest` tag to the action name like this:

```yml
uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@latest
```

If you want to make sure that your workflow doesn't suddenly break when a new major version is released, use the `v1` tag instead (recommended usage):

```yml
uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@v1
```

With the `v1` tag you will always get the latest non-breaking version which will include potential bug fixes in the future. If you use a specific version, make sure to regularly check if a new version is available, or enable Dependabot.

## ⚙️ Action Inputs

Here are all the inputs [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) takes:

| Key | Value | Required | Default |

### Outputs

The action sets the `pull_request_urls` output to the URLs of any created Pull Requests. It will be an array of URLs to each PR, e.g. `'["https://github.com/username/repository/pull/number", "..."]'`.

## 🛠️ Sync Configuration

In order to tell [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) what files to sync where, you have to create a `sync.yml` file in the `.github` directory of your main repository (see [action-inputs](#%EF%B8%8F-action-inputs) on how to change the location).

The top-level key should be used to specify the target repository in the format `username`/`repository-name`@`branch`, after that you can list all the files you want to sync to that individual repository:

```yml
user/repo:
  - path/to/file.txt
user/repo2@develop:
  - path/to/file2.txt
```

There are multiple ways to specify which files to sync to each individual repository.

### List individual file(s)

The easiest way to sync files is the list them on a new line for each repository:

```yml
user/repo:
  - .github/workflows/build.yml
  - LICENSE
  - .gitignore
```

### Different destination path/filename(s)

Using the `dest` option you can specify a destination path in the target repo and/or change the filename for each source file:

```yml
user/repo:
  - source: workflows/build.yml
    dest: .github/workflows/build.yml
  - source: LICENSE.md
    dest: LICENSE
```

### Sync entire directories

You can also specify entire directories to sync:

```yml
user/repo:
  - source: workflows/
    dest: .github/workflows/
```

### Exclude certain files when syncing directories

Using the `exclude` key you can specify files you want to exclude when syncing entire directories (#26).

```yml
user/repo:
  - source: workflows/
    dest: .github/workflows/
    exclude: |
      node.yml
      lint.yml
```

> **Note:** the exclude file path is relative to the source path

### Don't replace existing file(s)

By default if a file already exists in the target repository, it will be replaced. You can change this behaviour by setting the `replace` option to `false`:

```yml
user/repo:
  - source: .github/workflows/lint.yml
    replace: false
```

### Delete orphaned files

With the `deleteOrphaned` option you can choose to delete files in the target repository if they are deleted in the source repository. The option defaults to `false` and only works when [syncing entire directories](#sync-entire-directories):

```yml
user/repo:
  - source: workflows/
    dest: .github/workflows/
    deleteOrphaned: true
```

It only takes effect on that specific directory.

### Sync the same files to multiple repositories

Instead of repeating yourself listing the same files for multiple repositories, you can create a group:

```yml
group:
  repos: |
    user/repo
    user/repo1
  files: 
    - source: workflows/build.yml
      dest: .github/workflows/build.yml
    - source: LICENSE.md
      dest: LICENSE
```

You can create multiple groups like this:

```yml
group:
  # first group
  - files:
      - source: workflows/build.yml
        dest: .github/workflows/build.yml
      - source: LICENSE.md
        dest: LICENSE
    repos: |
      user/repo1
      user/repo2

  # second group
  - files: 
      - source: configs/dependabot.yml
        dest: .github/dependabot.yml
    repos: |
      user/repo3
      user/repo4
```

### Syncing branches

You can also sync different branches from the same or different repositories (#51). For example, a repository named `foo/bar` with branch `main`, and `sync.yml` contents:

```yml
group:
  repos: |
    foo/bar@de
    foo/bar@es
    foo/bar@fr
  files:
    - source: .github/workflows/
      dest: .github/workflows/
```

Here all files in `.github/workflows/` will be synced from the `main` branch to the branches `de`/`es`/`fr`.

## 📖 Examples

Here are a few examples to help you get started!

### Basic Example

**.github/sync.yml**

```yml
user/repository:
  - LICENSE
  - .gitignore
```

### Sync all workflow files

This example will keep all your `.github/workflows` files in sync across multiple repositories:

**.github/sync.yml**

```yml
group:
  repos: |
    user/repo1
    user/repo2
  files:
    - source: .github/workflows/
      dest: .github/workflows/
```

### Custom labels

By default [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) will add the `sync` label to every PR it creates. You can turn this off by setting `PR_LABELS` to false, or specify your own labels:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
  uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@v1
  with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    PR_LABELS: |
      file-sync
      automerge
```

### Assign a user to the PR

You can tell [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) to assign users to the PR with `ASSIGNEES`:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
  uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@v1
  with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    ASSIGNEES: BetaHuhn
```

### Request a PR review

You can tell [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) to request a review of the PR from users with `REVIEWERS` and from teams with `TEAM_REVIEWERS`:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
  uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@v1
  with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    REVIEWERS: |
      BetaHuhn
      BetaHuhnBot
    TEAM_REVIEWERS: engineering
```

### Custom GitHub Enterprise Host

If your target repository is hosted on a GitHub Enterprise Server you can specify a custom host name like this:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
https://custom.host/user/repo:
  - path/to/file.txt

# or in a group

group:
  - files:
      - source: path/to/file.txt
        dest: path/to/file.txt
    repos: |
      https://custom.host/user/repo
```

> **Note:** The key has to start with http to indicate that you want to use a custom host.

### Different branch prefix

By default all new branches created in the target repo will be in the this format: `repo-sync/SOURCE_REPO_NAME/SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME`, with the SOURCE_REPO_NAME being replaced with the name of the source repo and SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME with the name of the source branch.

If your repo name contains invalid characters, like a dot ([#32](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action/issues/32)), you can specify a different prefix for the branch (the text before `/SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME`):

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@v1
with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    BRANCH_PREFIX: custom-branch
```

The new branch will then be `custom-branch/SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME`.

> You can use `SOURCE_REPO_NAME` in your custom branch prefix as well and it will be replaced with the actual repo name

### Custom commit body

You can specify a custom commit body. This will be appended to the commit message, separated by two new lines. For example:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
  uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@v1
  with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    COMMIT_BODY: "Change-type: patch"
```

The above example would result in a commit message that looks something like this:
```
🔄 Synced local '<filename>' with remote '<filename>'

Change-type: patch
```

### Add content to the PR body

You can add more content to the PR body with the `PR_BODY` option. For example:

**.github/workflows/sync.yml**

```yml
- name: Run GitHub File Sync
  uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@v1
  with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    PR_BODY: This is your custom PR Body
```

It will be added below the first line of the body and above the list of changed files. The above example would result in a PR body that looks something like this:

```
Synced local file(s) with GITHUB_REPOSITORY.

This is your custom PR Body

▶ Changed files

---

This PR was created automatically by the repo-file-sync-action workflow run xxx.
```

### Fork and pull request workflow

If you do not wish to grant this action write access to target repositories, you can specify a bot/user Github acccount that you do have access to with the `FORK` parameter. 

A fork of each target repository will be created on this account, and all changes will be pushed to a branch on the fork, instead of upstream. Pull requests will be opened from the forks to target repositories.

Note: while you can open pull requests to target repositories without write access, some features, like applying labels, are not possible.

```yml
uses: BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action@v1
with:
    GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
    FORK: file-sync-bot
```

### Advanced sync config

Here's how I keep common files in sync across my repositories. The main repository [`github-files`](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/github-files) contains all the files I want to sync and the [repo-file-sync-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action) Action which runs on every push.

Using groups I can specify which file(s) should be synced to which repositories:

**.github/sync.yml**

```yml
group:
  # dependabot files
  - files:
      - source: configs/dependabot.yml
        dest: .github/dependabot.yml
      - source: workflows/dependencies/dependabot.yml
